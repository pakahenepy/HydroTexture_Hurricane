# HydroThunder-texture-extractor
a noesis script to VIEW the textures from hydro thunder hurricane into normal formats

this only work on the xbox 360 version, as far as im aware.

use wxpirs to extract the LIVE package, then use HyperBx's "barracuda" hyperlib extractor to isolate the textures from the main APF file.
([https://github.com/hyperbx/HyperLib](url))

then simply drag this file into C:.....\noesis\plugins\python folder, and view!

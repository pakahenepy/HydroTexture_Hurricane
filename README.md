A noesis script to VIEW the textures from the hydro thunder hurricane into standard formats

This only works on the Xbox 360 version, as far as I'm aware.

Use wxpirs to extract the LIVE package, then use HyperBx's "barracuda" hyperlib extractor to isolate the textures from the main APF file.

Then drag this file into C:.....\noesis\plugins\python folder, and view!
